# SWE573
This repository is for the project that I will work on every week for the SWE 573 class, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Suzan Uskudarli in Bogazici University.

Although the details of the project are not clear yet, it will be written in Python, and most probably will be using the Twitter API. 

Every week, a summary of the research I do will be posted on the wiki page of this repository. They will be titled "Week One", "Week Two" etc.

It is my hope that this repository will be kept up to date on a regular basis.
